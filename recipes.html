	   </h3>


	   <p>
         Like any GLUE resource, <b>CRESS-GLUE</b> is data-oriented, and can readily be
         developed in any direction. See <a href="recipes.html"><b>here</b></a>
         for some examples.
 	   </p>

	  <p>
		CRESS-GLUE can be used as a straightforward data repository (i.e. a place to 
		find an annotated set of CRESS DNA virus genomes, information about 
		CRESS DNA virus-derived EVEs, sequence alignments, and phylogenies.

	  <p>
		However, the most effective way to leverage the information collated in the
		CRESS-GLUE project is to load it into the 
		<a href="http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/"><b>GLUE</b></a>
		software framework, as described 
	    <a href="./installation.html"><b>here</b></a>.
