		<p>
          We have used GLUE to organise the fossil record of CRESS viruses.
		</p>

		<p>
          We applied a systematic approach to naming CVe. Each element was assigned a unique
          identifier (ID) constructed from a defined set of components.
          The first component is the classifier ‘ECV’. 
          The second is a composite of two distinct subcomponents separated by a period: 
          the name of CVe group (usually derived from the host group in which the element occurs in (e.g. Carnivora),
          and the second is a numeric ID that uniquely identifies the insertion.
          Orthologous copies in different species are given the same number, but are
          differentiated using the third component of the ID that uniquely identifies
          the species from which the sequence was obtained. In cases were a CVe element
          had expanded via duplication, an additional number was appended to the standard
          ID to discriminate individual duplicates.
