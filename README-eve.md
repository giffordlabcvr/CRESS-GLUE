# Circoviridae-EVE

## Description

Circoviridae-EVE is an open source virus sequence data resource focussed on [endogenous circoviral elements](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170217309048?via%3Dihub) (ECV).

Circoviridae-EVE is based on [GLUE](http://tools.glue.cvr.ac.uk), an open source, data-centric bioinformatics environment specialised for the analysis of virus sequence data.

We have created a core project - [Circoviridae-GLUE](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Circoviridae-GLUE) - for analysing circovirus (family Circoviridae) sequence data generally, and Circoviridae-EVE is an extension to this project. Circoviridae-GLUE contains reference information the circovirus family, including reference sequences representing all recognised circovirus species. It also contains alignments, trees, and other auxilliary data.

## What's the point of this resource

ECV sequences provide a unique source of retrospective information about the long-term evolution of circoviruses.

## Standard nomenclature for ECV loci

This project applies a standard nomenclature to ECV loci, following the model described for ERVs in paper cited below, except using the classifier 'ECV' rather than ERV.
