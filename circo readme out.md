Who can use this resource, and for what?

CRESS-GLUE can be used a straightforward data repository, with no requirement for use of the GLUE software framework.
[GLUE](http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk) is an open source, data-centric bioinformatics environment specialised for developing virus genome data resources (VGDR).

Circoviruses are small, non-enveloped viruses with circular, single stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes ~1.8 to ~2.1 kilobases (kb) in length. Circovirus genomes encode two major proteins: replication-associated protein (Rep) and capsid (Cap), responsible for genome replication and particle formation respectively. Transcription is bidirectional with the rep gene being encoded in the forward sense, and the cap gene being encoded in the complementary sense.

This [GLUE](http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk) project contains reference information for the circovirus family, including:
