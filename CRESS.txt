but given how common the Rep-encoding viruses seem to be in the environment - and as EVEs - I think a resource directed towards 'CRESS metagenomics’, so to speak, might be . 



I think some of the following features might be useful:


- Inferring the locations of features on sequences that lack annotations or are incompletely annotated. This may be useful for EVEs, or viruses obtained from GenBank, or generated in-house. GLUE's ‘inherit features’ command can be used to infer the locations of features on individual sequences, providing they are in an alignment with a reference sequence that has those features annotated. Note the features are inferred purely based on homology. 

- Obtaining the sequences (and associated locus information of CRESS DNA virus-derived EVEs. The website provides a repository of these sequences. In addition, when using GLUE these sequences can be interrogated based on their inferred genome features.a
